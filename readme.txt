Morpion is the french name for the tic-tac-toe game.

Morpion is build with Python, and is part of edX Homework 2 from the course
Python for Research.

In order to respect edX 'Academic Honesty' policy, all revised code published
by myself will have been already submitted.
Hence, committing a code revision has sole purpose to improve the project
to make it more efficient, more elegant,...
Thus it represents an occasion for those willing to share and demonstrate their
knowledge, as for me an occasion to improve myself.

Finally a peace of information:
a 'morpion' is actually a parasite that is famous for its peculiar taste to
take residence in one's private part hairs. Where is the relationship with the
game one may ask, well that could be a good topic for another P.Taylor
"What the fuck France" youtube video.
